## What I Learnt 
  - File Handling : learnt about the fstream library for handling files and the data types found in this library, even the modes when youwant to write, read and append.
  - New Library : I also discoverd a new library which is a vector used when you want to mark something from the library and delete something.
  - Error Management : Handling invalid user inputs and file operations
## Challenges I Faced 
  - How to mark something from thefile as done and how to delete something from it.
  - Creating a user friendly CLI interface with proper Input validation
## Future Improvements
  - Adding a menu to the list for adding your own file name
  - adding a settings menu to the list
  - make my code more user friendly when i fully understand how the vector library operates
## Actions of the App
